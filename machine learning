Machine learning is like teaching a computer to learn from examples instead of giving it direct instructions.

Imagine you show a computer many pictures of cats and dogs. Over time, it learns patterns (like cats usually have whiskers and dogs often have floppy ears). Then, when you show it a new picture, it can guess if it's a cat or a dog based on what it learned.

It's a way for computers to "get smarter" by practicing with data, much like humans learn by seeing and trying things.

To create a **trading program** that analyzes the Ethereum chart on the **daily timeframe** using **technical analysis** and the **Smart Money Concepts (SMC)** strategy, and sends notifications when there are buying opportunities, we’ll follow these steps:

### 1. **Data Source for Ethereum Daily Prices**
We'll fetch Ethereum price data from a crypto API such as **Binance** or **TradingView**, which provides OHLCV data (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume).

### 2. **Technical Analysis (TA) Indicators**
The program will use standard TA indicators to find potential entry and exit points:
   - **Moving Averages (MA)**: 50-day and 200-day MAs to spot trends.
   - **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**: To identify overbought (above 70) or oversold (below 30) conditions.
   - **Support and Resistance**: Key price levels where Ethereum might reverse.
   - **Fibonacci Retracement**: To detect potential pullback levels.

### 3. **Smart Money Concepts (SMC) Strategy**
SMC focuses on understanding how **institutional traders** move markets. We will use:
   - **Market Structure (Higher Highs & Lower Lows)**: Identify trends.
   - **Order Blocks**: Areas where large players place their orders.
   - **Liquidity Zones**: Points where liquidity pools accumulate (e.g., above previous highs or below lows).
   - **Fair Value Gaps (FVG)**: Imbalance areas in price where the market may retrace before moving forward.

### 4. **Signal Generation**
The program will analyze a confluence of TA and SMC signals to determine entry/exit points.
   - **Buy Signals**:
     - Price is in a demand zone (order block).
     - Market structure shows a higher low (bullish).
     - RSI is below 30 (indicating oversold).
     - A Fair Value Gap has been filled, signaling a potential reversal.
   - **Exit Signals**:
     - Price reaches a resistance level or liquidity zone.
     - RSI reaches overbought levels (above 70).
     - A trend reversal is detected (lower highs).

### 5. **Notification System**
The program will send **real-time notifications** when a buy opportunity arises, based on the analysis:
   - **Email or Telegram Alerts**: Using services like **SMTP** for emails or **Telegram Bot API** for messaging.

### Implementation in Python

#### 1. **Fetching Ethereum Data**
```python
import requests
import pandas as pd

def fetch_eth_data():
    url = "https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines"
    params = {
        "symbol": "ETHUSDT",
        "interval": "1d",  # Daily timeframe
        "limit": 100  # Number of days
    }
    response = requests.get(url, params=params)
    data = response.json()

    # Convert to DataFrame
    df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['timestamp', 'open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume', 'close_time', 'qav', 'num_trades', 'tbav', 'tqav', 'ignore'])
    df['timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(df['timestamp'], unit='ms')
    return df[['timestamp', 'open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume']].astype(float)
```

#### 2. **Applying Technical Indicators**
Using the **ta-lib** or **pandas-ta** library, we can compute technical indicators.

```python
import pandas_ta as ta

def apply_technical_indicators(df):
    df['50_MA'] = df['close'].rolling(window=50).mean()  # 50-day Moving Average
    df['200_MA'] = df['close'].rolling(window=200).mean()  # 200-day Moving Average
    df['RSI'] = ta.rsi(df['close'], length=14)  # RSI with 14-day window
    return df
```

#### 3. **SMC Logic for Market Structure and Order Blocks**
SMC will be implemented to detect **order blocks** and **market structure** changes.

```python
def detect_market_structure(df):
    df['high_shifted'] = df['high'].shift(1)
    df['low_shifted'] = df['low'].shift(1)
    df['market_structure'] = np.where(df['high'] > df['high_shifted'], 'bullish', 'bearish')
    return df

def find_order_blocks(df):
    df['order_block'] = (df['low'] == df['low'].rolling(5).min()) & (df['high'] == df['high'].rolling(5).max())
    return df
```

#### 4. **Generating Buy and Exit Signals**
Signals are generated based on **confluence** of indicators and SMC strategy.

```python
def generate_signals(df):
    signals = []

    for i in range(1, len(df)):
        if (df['RSI'][i] < 30) and (df['market_structure'][i] == 'bullish'):
            signals.append('BUY')
        else:
            signals.append('HOLD')

    df['signals'] = signals
    return df
```

#### 5. **Sending Notifications**
We’ll send notifications via **email**.

```python
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

def send_notification(signal, price):
    msg = MIMEText(f"Signal: {signal} at price {price}")
    msg['Subject'] = "Ethereum Buy Signal"
    msg['From'] = "your_email@example.com"
    msg['To'] = "recipient@example.com"

    with smtplib.SMTP('smtp.example.com', 587) as server:
        server.starttls()
        server.login("your_email@example.com", "password")
        server.sendmail("your_email@example.com", "recipient@example.com", msg.as_string())
```

### 6. **Program Workflow**
1. **Fetch Ethereum daily data**.
2. **Apply technical indicators** (Moving Averages, RSI).
3. **Use SMC strategy** to identify order blocks and market structure.
4. **Generate signals** when conditions are met.
5. **Send notifications** via email or messaging services when buy opportunities arise.

### Optional Enhancements
- **Backtesting**: Test the strategy on historical data for performance.
- **Automation**: Deploy the script on a cloud server (like AWS or Google Cloud) for continuous analysis.
